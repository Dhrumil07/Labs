## Description

MindSpark labs is a website that aims to provide quality and practical education throughout India. The gap between students and access to quality lab facilities is bridged by this website.
- There are 2 separate logins, one for colleges(which provide various lab facilities) and other for students(which wish to access the labs)
- Colleges will provide the details of their labs along with the preferable timings when the labs are accessible and the capacity of the lab.
- Students will be able to see all the available labs and can filter out labs based on departments and their vicinity.
- On booking the lab, a unique slot id is provided to student and the college is notified about the student who booked the lab. If the available slots for a particular lab are filled, student is notified about the same.
- Students can see all their booked labs and can know which labs they have booked.
